<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The deadline hour is 23:55 on the deadline day.</li>
	<li>The exercises must be submitted via the <a href="http://moodle.tau.ac.il/course/view.php?id=411312201" target="_blank">Moodle</a> system</li>
	<li>Sumbit an <em>ipynb</em> file, file name: <em>exX_id.py</em> (replace <em>X</em> with exercise number and <em>id</em> with your ID number). For example, the sumbission of exercise 5 for a student with ID number 033545885 is <em>ex5_033545885ipynb</em></li>
	<li>Submitted code must run on IPython Notebook with Python 3.4.</li>
	<li>Some of the questions are checked automatically only. Hence:<br>
	- <em>Do not change</em> given function names, arguments list and types. <br>
	- Make sure that the returned values are exactly as required.
	<li>Grades will be returned via the Moodle system, solutions will appear on the course website (here).</li>
	<li>There will be 7 exercises: 4 during the first 4 weeks and 3 during the next 6 weeks.</li>
	<li>Exercises grades are 0, 60, 80, 90 and 100.</li>
	<li>Students must submit and pass (grade >= 60) at least 6 exercises to complete the course.</li>
	<li>The exercises grade will contribute 20-30% of the final grade, but only if the exam grade is >= 60. The exercises grade will be the average of the 6 best grades.</li>
	<li><em>The exercises are personal and should be solved alone.</em> Students are not allowed to solve exercises together, show solutions to other students or read other students' solutions.</li>
	<li>Exercises can be discussed without sharing code.</li>
	<li>Each student has 5 days of "grace" for late submissions. For each late submission we take off a full day (or days) of "grace", even it the exercise was submitted two minutes after the deadline. If a student has no more days of "grace", late exercises will not be checked and will be graded with a zero.</li>
	<li>In case of a late submission, students should <em>not</em> contact staff members. If the late submission is justified, students should attach the relevant documents (sick days, reserve duty etc.) to the submission. This includes cases in which there is a malfunction with the Moodle system.</li>
