<h3>Project guidelines</h3>
<p>
	The goal of the final project is to present a small research project involving computational methods and tools, implemented using what you have learned during the course.
</p>
<p>
	You may choose any subject or question, preferably one which is connected to your research or for which you have available data. If you have no available data or no idea for a research question, consult your supervisor or one of the course instructors.
</p>
<h4>Presentation</h4>
<p>
	Projects will be presented as research posters at a poster session, which will take place on the afternoon of June 17<sup>th</sup> 2015.
</p>
<p>
	Posters should contain the following sections:
	<dl>
		<dt>
			Abstract
		</dt>
		<dd>
			general background and overview of the project. What is the research question and what are the expected results?
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Methods
		</dt>
		<dd>description of the data used, the analysis performed, algorithm used to implement the analysis and statistical tests applied to the data.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Results
		</dt>
		<dd>
			summary of the analysis results, statistical analyses etc.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Summary
		</dt>
		<dd>
			conclusions drawn from the results, answers to the biological question and comparison to the expected results.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	All sections may, and should, be accompanied by appropriate figures and tables, especially to clarify the results and their biological meaning.
</p>
<p>
	Some examples of posters can be found here:
	<ul class="list-unordered">
		<li>

		</li>

		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Posters should be printed on A0 paper or fabric for display in the poster session. You can print through the <a href="http://www.copy-center-ta.co.il/"><em>Copy Center</em></a> which is located in the campus or in another printing office. A recommended one is <em>Speedograph</em> in Tel-Aviv (Tel. <a href="tel:03-546-1604">03-546-1604</a>). They do same-day deliveries to the universoty.
</p>
<p>
	Ask your adviser for the required funding. If this is a problem, consult one of the instructors.
</p>
<h4>Code</h4>
<p>
	You should use python code to perform the processing and analysis of the data, . You may use any python module you see fit or any external code, as long as the main body of the code is original.
</p>
<p>
	External software and tools such as Microsoft Excel, text editors or analytic software may be used in processing the data, and if possible embedded within the python code. The core analysis should be performed with python code, including statistical analysis, plotting etc. If you are not sure, please ask in the forum or via email.
</p>
<h4>Project submission</h4>
<p>
	The final submission will include the following:

	<dl>
		<dt>
			Poster
		</dt>
		<dd>
			as presented in the poster session. A single PDF file.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Code
		</dt>
		<dd>
			all the code used for the processing and analysis of the data should be included in one IPython notebook. The code should be readable and clear, including comments, function documentation, explanations and usage instructions outside the code. It is important that the code can be run and the results are reproducible.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Data
		</dt>
		<dd>
			the original data on which analyses were performed. Again, make sure that using the code on the provided data, the results may be reproduced. The data can either be added to the submission in a zip file or a link should be provided inside the notebook.
		</dd>
	</dl>
</p>
<p>
	Final submissions will be done through the Moodle website. <strong>Due date is one week after the poster session â€“ June 24<sup>th</sup> at 23:55</strong>.
</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
An abstract must be submitted <strong>before May 1<sup>st</sup></strong>. Abstracts should be submitted as one page PDF documents, briefly depicting the biological background, the data and the planned analyses. Include the names on other researchers that will help you with the data collection or analysis.

<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>
	Project grading will be based on research problem (shouldn't be trivial), presentation quality, code readability and clarity, code efficiency (in terms of what we learned in the course), usage of the right tools and modules.
</p>

<h4>Help</h4>
<p>
	Questions regarding the project are welcome. Use the course forum or consult one of the instructors for questions about the instructions or the programming involved. You are also encouraged to consult your adviser or anyone else; however, the actual code should be written by you. Please start working on the projects as soon as possible and ask your questions early, so we can attend to all issues.
